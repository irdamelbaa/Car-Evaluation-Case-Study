Car Evaluation Case Study ðŸš—
This project focuses on determining the classification of cars based on their features using a machine learning approach. By analyzing a car's characteristics, such as safety, price, and comfort, this study aims to predict whether a car is acceptable for purchase or not.
ðŸ“„ Project Overview
The Car Evaluation Dataset is used in this case study to classify cars into different categories. The dataset contains information about car features and their evaluation based on specific criteria such as safety, buying price, and maintenance cost.

The goal is to build a classification model to predict a car's acceptability level:

Unacceptable
Acceptable
Good
Very Good
